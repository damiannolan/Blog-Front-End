# Overview

## An AngularJS Blogging application based on the Tumblr dashboard.

This repository contains the Front End submission of a 3rd Year Undergraduate project in Data Representation and Querying.
The project aims to demonstrate a well-managed and steady effort to create a useful and easy-to-use web application.

The Front End acts as a Consumer of a Back End API written in the programming language Python using the
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. The repository for the Back End API can be found [Here!](https://github.com/seantking/Blog-back-end)

The application features the ability to retrieve, create and delete blog posts using AngularJS's
[$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http) and [$q](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q) services
 together with the endpoints/routes offered by the Python Flask API.
