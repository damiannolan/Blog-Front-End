# Overview

## An AngularJS Blogging application based on the Tumblr dashboard.

This repository contains the Front End submission of a 3rd Year Undergraduate project in Data Representation and Querying.
The project aims to demonstrate a well-managed and steady effort to create a useful and easy-to-use web application.

The Front End acts as a Consumer of a Back End API written in the programming language Python using the
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. The repository for the Back End API can be found [Here!](https://github.com/seantking/Blog-back-end)

The application features the ability to retrieve, create and delete blog posts using AngularJS's
[$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http) and [$q](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q) services
 together with the endpoints/routes offered by the Python Flask API.

### Teamwork

- Damian Nolan
- Sean King

A large portion of this project was done using 'Pair Programming', an Agile Software Development technique in which two
programming work together at one workstation.
We felt this was an effective workflow as we both got to understand the full scope of the project.

To get started head on over to the [Back End Respository](https://github.com/seantking/Blog-back-end) and get setup!
